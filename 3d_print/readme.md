# Design

The design was done in Blender 2.90.0.  I needed something more powerful than Tinkercad and didn't want to buy&learn Fusion 360.
The 'panel' is comprised of 3 parts.
- Semi-transparent 'backlight' tiles
  - These are most of what the 'panel' is made of
  - Diffuse the LED light a bit
- Opaque Cap
  - These are the 'hexagons' that go into the panel
- Connectors
  - Small tabs used to reinforce the connection between tiles when you glue them together

The .blend file containes all three parts modeled in it.  They are partly generated with modifiers like 'arrays' and such.  I've forgotten the details of what I did in here.  But to get the separate STL files, I just selected the pieces I needed from the .blend.  The STL export has the capability to export just selected items.  That's how I 'split' the design into separate files
